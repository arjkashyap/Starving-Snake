<h3>  Starving Snake: Online Casual Game </h3>

<hr/>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p> An simple web page game based on the classic <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)"> Snake Game.</a> I made this to practise JavaScript as I am a biggener in this language. Also I have added some modifications in the gameplay and rules so there's a twist:</p>

<h4>Game Play</h4>
<p> The Old rules are the same: </p>
<ul>
    <li> If the snake's head touches the tail, it dies.</li>
    <li> If its head collides with the wall, it dies </li>
    <li> The game is endless. 1 point added to score with each mouse consumed. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Rules modified: </h4>
<ul>
    <li> Size of the snake is constantly decreasing. Once the size falls below 1 cube, it dies -  Game over</li>
    <li> Size of the snake increases mouse consumed, so you have to constatnly eat to keep up with the decreasing size.</li>
    <li> The rate at which the size is decreasing accelerates throughout the game to make it even harder. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Technology stack: </h3>

    <li> HTML</li>
    <li> CSS </li>
    <li> JavaScript</li>
</ul>
